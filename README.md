ENGLISH: Wilson, the castway
Wilson decided to drink wine and drive his airpline. Bad idea!
He ended up crashing his plane on a desert island, full of snakes! Yikes!
Now he needs to send a message to his family of his whereabouts.
Since Wilson does not have a very heartwarming relationship with his relatives, he has to convince his family
to come pick him up. Help him write letters and send them inside his wine bottles.
But remember to keep our friend hydrated and away from the snakes!

This game is part of the first project from the IronHack course, to create a game using tools learned on the past 4 days of studies (Classes, Functions/Methods, Parameters, For/While loops, If-Else, etc.) I decided to explore the functional paradigm for characters statuses just like an old-school RPG.
