e necessita convencê-los de virem buscá-lo.
Ajude Wilson a escrever cartas convincentes e enviá-las à sua família, através de suas garrafas de vinho.
Mas apresse-se, do contrário os perigos da ilha podem lhe custar a vida.

ENGLISH: Wilson, the castway
Wilson decided to drink and drive his airpline. Bad idea!
He ended up crashing his plane on a desert island, full of snakes! Yikes!
Now he needs to send a message to his family of his whereabouts.
Since Wilson does not have a very heartwarming relationship with his relatives, he has to convince his family
to come pick him up. Help him write the letters and send them inside his wine bottles.
But hurry up, otherwise Wilson will become a prey to the dangers of the island
